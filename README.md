*My machine is a Macbook Pro running OSX El Capitan. I am using bash. As such, all instructions going forth is tested for this environment.*

Dependencies
--------

- Node.js v6.9.1
- npm v3.10.8

Setup
-----

*I find installing nvm to be the best way to install node quickly from the terminal. nvm is also just a great tool for managing different versions of node that a project may require. I hope this is allowed as part of the challenge! Otherwise you can also install node by downloading a pkg [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).*

1. Install nvm: https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script
1. Install node version 6.9.1: `nvm install 6.9.1`
1. Make sure you are in the project directory's root. Install node modules: `npm install`


Running tests
